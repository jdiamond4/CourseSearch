# HoosList: Smart Course Discovery for UVA Students

## My Mission

My goal is to build a smarter, more modern course search solution that goes beyond basic course catalogs. This is going to be a platform that helps UVA students make informed decisions by comparing not just typical course information, but also instructor GPAs and ratings to find the best learning experience. I found that this was the most important yet unknown piece of information about courses yet it was always so hard to quickly find and compare to the course options open during enrollment. 

## What We're Building

### Current Features
- **Smart Course Filtering**: Search by department, course level, enrollment status, and instructor GPA
- **Real-time Data**: Live enrollment information and up-to-date course details
- **GPA Integration**: See instructor ratings and GPAs from theCourseForum.com
- **Modern Interface**: Clean, intuitive design with UVA branding (Navy & Orange)
- **Multi-Department Categories**: Browse related departments together (e.g., Quantitative Sciences, Romance Languages)
- **Dynamic Landing Page**: CSV-driven button configuration for easy customization
- **Pagination**: Efficient browsing through large course catalogs

### Future Vision
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Custom searches that fit your specific schedule and preferences
- **Smart Scheduling**: Intelligent suggestions based on your academic goals and time constraints
- **Predictive Analytics**: Course difficulty predictions and success rate insights
- **Personalized Experience**: Learning from your preferences to suggest better course combinations

## Why This Matters
