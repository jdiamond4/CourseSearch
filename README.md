## What This Is

This is the first MVP of a UVA course search tool that combines the best features of:
- **Lou's List** - Course availability and enrollment data
- **CourseForum** - Instructor ratings and GPA data  
- **Stellic** - Course planning based on requirements

## Current Features (MVP)

- **Course Catalog**: Browse CS courses with real-time enrollment data
- **Section Details**: View individual lecture sections and labs
- **Instructor GPAs**: See average GPAs from CourseForum data
- **Status Tracking**: Check if courses are open, waitlisted, or full
- **Time & Location**: Course schedules and classroom locations

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Scrapes course data from webhooks
2. **Integration**: Combines enrollment data with instructor ratings
3. **Display**: Shows everything in one clean, searchable interface

## Future Goals

- **AI Course Discovery**: Find interesting, easy classes that fit your schedule
- **Smart Recommendations**: Suggest courses based on your interests and GPA preferences
- **Degree Planning**: Help plan your course schedule to graduate on time


This MVP shows the basic concept. The real goal is to build something that makes it easy for UVA students to discover great classes and plan their academic journey.
